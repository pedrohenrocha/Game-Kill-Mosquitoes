# Game-Kill-Mosquitoes
A playful game developed with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

This application was developed for study purposes.

I used JS, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

The main objective is to kill all the mosquitoes before the end of the stopwatch.

It was implemented different levels of difficulty, which changes the duration of showing targets.

The position of targets changes randomly, as well as their sizes and orientation (to the right or the left).

If 3 mosquitoes escape from you, you lose. So, be fast and have a good night :)
